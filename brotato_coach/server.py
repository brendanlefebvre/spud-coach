        x crit damage are all folded in (integer truncation/rounding included,
        matching the game's own arithmetic) — not just ranged damage. It

        (expected on-hit proc damage, e.g. exploding projectiles — chance x
        the weapon's own damage line). `aoe_enemies_hit` scales the proc term
        for AoE procs (default 1 enemy, conservative). Effect keys the model
        can't yet value are listed in `unmodeled_effects` — mention them when
        the number matters. `stats` is the player's current run stats (short
        names, e.g. ranged_damage) and must be DISPLAYED values (what the
        game shows, after the character's stat-gain modifiers) — pass

        ranking several weapons, use compare_weapons; for merge-order
        questions, use compare_merge_paths; for 'which stat should I buy
        next', use stat_gradient.

        The `assumptions` object reports what was baked into this number:
        `aoe_enemies_hit`, `engagement_distance` (melee only — defaults to
        `min(max_range, 70)` when the weapon is melee and you don't override
        it), and `set_bonuses_applied`. Pass `loadout` (the whole equipped
        weapon-name list) to report the loadout's active weapon-class set
        bonuses under `assumptions.active_set_bonuses`; pass
        `apply_set_bonuses=True` to additionally MERGE those bonuses into
        `stats` before computing DPS — only do this for stat blocks that
        don't already include them (a manually-typed build), never for
        screen/save-derived stats, which already have set bonuses baked in
        and would double-count them.

        `cadence` decomposes DPS into rate x burst: attacks_per_second,
        damage_per_attack, a cadence label (sustained/moderate/bursty),
        seconds_between_attacks, and gap_range_s — the verified dead-window
        range between volleys. gap_range_s widens with `weapon_count` (the
        engine randomizes cooldowns to de-sync volleys, harder with more
        weapons); pass your actual equipped count for a real range.
        burst_reload flags bimodal reload weapons (Revolver, Chain Gun) whose
