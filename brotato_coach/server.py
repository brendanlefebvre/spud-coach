stale, incomplete, or wrong for the loaded game version (balance patches,
renamed items, new content) — never answer a Brotato weapon/item/character/

if the question seems simple or you're confident you already know the
answer. If no tool seems to fit, call get_filter_options or list_items /
list_weapons to check what actually exists before concluding something isn't
present. Call check_dataset_version if you need to confirm which game
version these facts are from. Start each session by calling read_me once —
