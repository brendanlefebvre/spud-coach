# Brotato Coach

A deterministic theorycrafter for [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/),
delivered as an MCP server you can chat with from Claude Code (and other MCP clients).

The design principle: **a deterministic core holds the ground truth** — weapon/item/character
data, DPS formulas, stat mechanics — so the language model *looks facts up and computes* instead
of recalling (and misremembering) them. Every tool returns a finished, verifiable answer or a
structured error; there are no baked-in tier lists or opinions, only facts and math.

The dataset (`data/brotato.json`) is **not committed** — it is derived from copyrighted game
files, so you build it yourself from a local Brotato install (see [Building the dataset](#building-the-dataset)).
A full build from **Brotato 1.1.15.4** contains **202 weapons, 197 items, 50 characters, and 15
weapon-class sets**.

## Requirements

- Python **3.11+**
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment/dependency management

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Quick start

Build the dataset (needs a local extraction — see [Building the dataset](#building-the-dataset)),
then start the server:

```bash
uv run python build_dataset.py --game-version 1.1.15.4 \
    --generated-at $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)     # writes data/brotato.json
uv run python -m brotato_coach.server                 # starts the MCP server over stdio
```

The server refuses to start without `data/brotato.json` and tells you to build it first.

Run the tests (the dataset-dependent integration test is skipped when no dataset is built):

```bash
uv run pytest        # 49 tests (48 passed + 1 skipped without a built dataset)
```

## Use as a Claude Code plugin

The MCP server is described by [`plugin/.mcp.json`](plugin/.mcp.json):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brotato-coach": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "brotato_coach.server"],
      "cwd": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    }
  }
}
```

The server reads the (locally built) `data/brotato.json` relative to its working directory, so
**it must run with the repository root as its `cwd`** (the manifest handles this via
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` when bundled as a plugin), and you must
[build the dataset](#building-the-dataset) first.

To register it directly in Claude Code without packaging, add the server pointed at your checkout,
e.g.:

```bash
claude mcp add brotato-coach -- uv run --directory /path/to/brotato-exam python -m brotato_coach.server
```

Once connected, just ask in natural language — the model routes your question to the tools below:

- *"Does Handcuffs fit my Ranger run? I'm at 7 ranged damage, 65 HP."*
- *"Minigun T4 vs Revolver T4 at 20 ranged damage — which hits harder?"*
- *"Is attack speed ever dead weight? Can I let knockback go negative on a gun build?"*
- *"What does the Ranger's ranged-damage bonus do to a raw stat of 6?"*

## Available tools

All tools return a JSON object. Lookups that miss return `{"error": "not_found", "did_you_mean": [...]}`.

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `get_weapon` | `name`, `tier?` | Weapon record incl. precomputed DPS line; `{matches:[...]}` if `tier` omitted and several tiers match |
| `get_item` | `name` | Item record: effects, tags, `archetype`, `frozen_stat` |
| `get_character` | `name` | Character kit: `wanted_tags`, `banned_item_groups`, `flat_bonuses`, `gain_modifiers`, `special_effects` |
| `get_set` | `class_name` | Weapon-class set bonuses, by equipped count |
| `list_weapons` | `scaling_stat?`, `tier?` | `{weapons:[...]}` filtered summaries |
| `list_items` | `tag?`, `scaling_stat?`, `archetype?`, `tier?` | `{items:[...]}` filtered summaries |
| `weapon_dps` | `name`, `tier`, `stats` | Realized DPS at the given stats, with breakdown |
| `compare_weapons` | `names_with_tiers`, `stats` | `{ranking:[...]}` sorted by DPS descending |
| `compare_merge_paths` | `weapon_name`, `path_a`, `path_b` | Winner or crossover RD for two merge paths (lists of tiers) |
| `explain_stat` | `stat` | Verified stat mechanics: caps, special behavior, neglectable / never-negative flags |
| `stat_display_value` | `character`, `stat`, `raw_value` | Displayed value after the character's gain modifiers (e.g. Ranger RD 6 → 9) |
| `evaluate_item_for_build` | `item_name`, `character_name`, `current_stats` | Per-effect verdict — **live / wasted / harmful** — with reasons, plus a summary |
| `check_dataset_version` | — | `game_version`, `generated_at`, `schema_version` |

`stats` / `current_stats` are objects keyed by short stat name (e.g. `{"ranged_damage": 7, "max_hp": 65}`).
`names_with_tiers` is a list of `[name, tier]` pairs. `path_a` / `path_b` are lists of tier numbers.

## Building the dataset

The dataset is **not committed** — it is built from an extraction of a real game install. The raw
`extracted/`, the decompiled `recovered/`, the copyrighted `game_files/`, and the derived
`data/brotato.json` are all gitignored (see [`docs/extraction-setup.md`](docs/extraction-setup.md)
for how the extraction is produced). Once `extracted/` is present at the repo root:

```bash
uv run python build_dataset.py \
    --game-version 1.1.15.4 \
    --generated-at $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
```

This writes `data/brotato.json`. Supply the actual installed Brotato version to `--game-version`
(it is not recorded inside the `.pck`; check the Steam client). Re-run after each patch and commit
the regenerated dataset.

## How it works

```
extracted/  (gitignored, regenerable)          raw .tres game data
     │
     ▼   build_dataset.py   (offline, per patch)
data/brotato.json  (committed, enriched)        the deterministic core artifact
     │
     ▼   loaded at startup
brotato_coach.server (FastMCP)                  13 tools over the pure functions
     │
     ▼   connected as a plugin
Claude Code / Desktop / Web                     chat frontend
```

- `brotato_coach/tres.py` — a minimal Godot `.tres` parser.
- `brotato_coach/builders/` — turn parsed `.tres` into enriched records (weapons with precomputed DPS
  lines, items with archetype flags, characters with gain modifiers, sets, and the verified
  `stat_mechanics` table).
- `brotato_coach/calc.py` — pure DPS / merge math (no I/O), unit-tested against hand-verified values.
- `brotato_coach/{query,answers,evaluate}.py` — pure functions that produce finished answers.
- `brotato_coach/server.py` — thin FastMCP wrappers over those functions.

Reference material on the game mechanics the coach encodes lives in [`docs/`](docs/)
(extraction setup, weapon-merge DPS methodology, run post-mortem methodology, stat mechanics).
