# Brotato Coach

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.brendanlefebvre/spudcoach -->

A deterministic theorycrafter for [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/),
delivered as an MCP server you can chat with from Claude Code (and other MCP clients).

The design principle: **a deterministic core holds the ground truth** — weapon/item/character
data, DPS formulas, stat mechanics — so the language model *looks facts up and computes* instead
of recalling (and misremembering) them. Every tool returns a finished, verifiable answer or a
structured error; there are no baked-in tier lists or opinions, only facts and math.

The dataset (`data/brotato.json`) is **not committed** — it is derived from copyrighted game
files, so you build it yourself from a local Brotato install (see [Building the dataset](#building-the-dataset)).
A full build from **Brotato 1.1.15.4** contains **202 weapons, 197 items, 50 characters, and 15
weapon-class sets**.

## Requirements

- Python **3.11+**
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment/dependency management

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Quick start

Build the dataset (needs a local extraction — see [Building the dataset](#building-the-dataset)),
then start the server:

```bash
uv run python build_dataset.py                        # writes data/brotato.json
uv run python -m brotato_coach.server                 # starts the MCP server over stdio
```

The server refuses to start without `data/brotato.json` and tells you to build it first.

Run the tests (the dataset-dependent integration test is skipped when no dataset is built):

```bash
uv run pytest        # 89 tests (88 passed + 1 skipped without a built dataset)
```

## Run

```bash
uvx spudcoach --data /path/to/brotato.json
```

The dataset is never distributed — build your own from your Brotato install:
`uv run python build_dataset.py` (see [docs/extraction-setup.md](docs/extraction-setup.md)).
Game version auto-detects from the decompiled `recovered/singletons/progress_data.gd`, and
`generated_at` defaults to the current UTC time — pass `--game-version`/`--generated-at`
explicitly to override either. `SPUDCOACH_DATA` works as an env-var alternative to `--data`.

## Use as a Claude Code plugin

The MCP server is described by [`plugin/.mcp.json`](plugin/.mcp.json):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brotato-coach": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "brotato_coach.server"],
      "cwd": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    }
  }
}
```

The server reads the (locally built) `data/brotato.json` relative to its working directory, so
**it must run with the repository root as its `cwd`** (the manifest handles this via
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` when bundled as a plugin), and you must
[build the dataset](#building-the-dataset) first.

To register it directly in Claude Code without packaging, add the server pointed at your checkout,
e.g.:

```bash
claude mcp add brotato-coach -- uv run --directory /path/to/brotato-exam python -m brotato_coach.server
```

Once connected, just ask in natural language — the model routes your question to the tools below:

- *"Does Handcuffs fit my Ranger run? I'm at 7 ranged damage, 65 HP."*
- *"Minigun T4 vs Revolver T4 at 20 ranged damage — which hits harder?"*
- *"Is attack speed ever dead weight? Can I let knockback go negative on a gun build?"*
- *"What does the Ranger's ranged-damage bonus do to a raw stat of 6?"*
- *"Here's my run.json — how's this build doing?"* (post-mortem a whole save at once)

## Use with Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop can launch the server with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) in two forms: fetch
straight from this repo (auto-updates on restart, but needs `git` reachable — see the Windows note
below), or point at a **local checkout** (nothing fetched at runtime; the most reliable form on
Windows). Either way you supply your own locally built `brotato.json` — the dataset is never
distributed.

1. Install `uv` on the machine running Claude Desktop (`winget install astral-sh.uv` on Windows,
   or the [standalone installer](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).
2. Open the config file and add the `spud-coach` server:
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

   Fetch-from-repo form:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "spud-coach": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": [
           "--from", "git+https://github.com/brendanlefebvre/spud-coach",
           "spudcoach",
           "--data", "C:\\Users\\<you>\\path\\to\\brotato.json"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Point `--data` at your built dataset (`SPUDCOACH_DATA` works as an env-var alternative). On macOS
   use a POSIX path like `/Users/<you>/brotato.json`.
3. Fully restart Claude Desktop (quit from the tray, not just close the window).

### Windows: "Git executable not found" (or `uvx` not found)

The `git+https://…` form makes uv shell out to a `git` executable. **Claude Desktop does not pass
your shell — or even your System `PATH` — to the MCP subprocess;** it spawns servers with its own
trimmed environment. (The `PATH` it prints in the logs is its command-resolution list, *not* what
the child process receives.) So a `git` that runs fine in PowerShell, installed in a System-`PATH`
directory, can still come back "not found" here — and a bare `"command": "uvx"` can fail to resolve
for the same reason. Two fixes:

- **Point at a local checkout — no runtime git (recommended).** Clone once in a terminal where git
  works, then use `--from <folder>` instead of `--from git+…`:

  ```powershell
  git clone https://github.com/brendanlefebvre/spud-coach C:\Users\<you>\src\spud-coach
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "spud-coach": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["--from", "C:\\Users\\<you>\\src\\spud-coach", "spudcoach",
                 "--data", "C:\\Users\\<you>\\path\\to\\brotato.json"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Update later with `git pull` in that folder, then restart Desktop.

- **Or force the tools onto the server's `PATH`.** Keep the `git+https` form and add an `env` block
  that hands the child an explicit `PATH` — git, plus uv's bin and the winget-links dir:

  ```json
  "env": {
    "PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd;C:\\Users\\<you>\\.local\\bin;C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WinGet\\Links;C:\\Windows\\System32"
  }
  ```

  If `uvx` itself still isn't found, also set `"command"` to its absolute path (`Get-Command uvx` to
  locate it, e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\uvx.exe`).

## Available tools

All tools return a JSON object. Lookups that miss return `{"error": "not_found", "did_you_mean": [...]}`.

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `get_weapon` | `name`, `tier?` | Weapon record incl. precomputed DPS line, on-hit `effects`, and weapon-class `sets`; `{matches:[...]}` if `tier` omitted and several tiers match |
| `get_item` | `name` | Item record: effects, tags, `archetype`, `frozen_stat` |
| `get_character` | `name` | Character kit: `wanted_tags`, `banned_item_groups`, `flat_bonuses`, `gain_modifiers`, `special_effects` |
| `get_weapon_class_set` | `class_name` | Weapon-**class** set bonuses (Blade, Gun, Elemental, …), by equipped count |
| `loadout_set_bonuses` | `weapon_names` | Per-class set progress across a whole loadout: equipped count, active bonuses, and next threshold |
| `list_weapons` | `scaling_stat?`, `tier?` | `{weapons:[...]}` filtered summaries |
| `list_items` | `tag?`, `scaling_stat?`, `archetype?`, `tier?` | `{items:[...]}` filtered summaries |
| `get_filter_options` | — | Valid filter values in the dataset: item tags, archetypes, scaling stats, tiers, and weapon-class names |
| `weapon_dps` | `name`, `tier`, `stats` | Realized DPS at the given stats, with breakdown |
| `compare_weapons` | `names_with_tiers`, `stats` | `{ranking:[...]}` sorted by DPS descending |
| `compare_merge_paths` | `weapon_name`, `path_a`, `path_b` | Winner or crossover RD for two merge paths (lists of tiers) |
| `explain_stat` | `stat` | Verified stat mechanics: caps, special behavior, neglectable / never-negative flags |
| `stat_display_value` | `character`, `stat`, `raw_value` | Displayed value after the character's gain modifiers (e.g. Ranger RD 6 → 9) |
| `evaluate_item_for_build` | `item_name`, `character_name`, `current_stats` | Per-effect verdict — **live / wasted / harmful** — with reasons, plus a summary |
| `evaluate_run` | `path?` **or** `run_json?` | One-call post-mortem of a whole Brotato `run.json` save: run context (character, wave, danger), realized stats, weapon-DPS ranking, set progress, and per-item verdicts |
| `check_dataset_version` | — | `game_version`, `generated_at`, `schema_version` |

`stats` / `current_stats` are objects keyed by short stat name (e.g. `{"ranged_damage": 7, "max_hp": 65}`).
`names_with_tiers` is a list of `[name, tier]` pairs. `path_a` / `path_b` are lists of tier numbers.
Note the two stat-name forms: `stats` / `current_stats` use the **short** name (`ranged_damage`), while the `stat` argument of `explain_stat` and `stat_display_value` uses the **`stat_`-prefixed** form (`stat_ranged_damage`). `get_filter_options` returns the valid filter values so you don't have to guess (all filters are case-sensitive exact matches).

`evaluate_run` takes exactly one input: pass the save's contents as `run_json` (e.g. an uploaded/pasted `run.json`) **or** its location as `path` (e.g. a file in your Brotato save directory). The save is read-only — it is never modified. Ids the loaded dataset doesn't recognize (e.g. content newer than your build) are listed under `notes` rather than dropped; a malformed save returns `{"error": "bad_run_file", ...}`.

## Building the dataset

The dataset is **not committed** — it is built from an extraction of a real game install. The raw
`extracted/`, the decompiled `recovered/`, the copyrighted `game_files/`, and the derived
`data/brotato.json` are all gitignored (see [`docs/extraction-setup.md`](docs/extraction-setup.md)
for how the extraction is produced). Once `extracted/` is present at the repo root:

```bash
uv run python build_dataset.py
```

This writes `data/brotato.json`. Game version auto-detects from the decompiled
`recovered/singletons/progress_data.gd` (its `VERSION` constant), and `generated_at` defaults to
the current UTC time. Pass `--game-version <ver>` or `--generated-at <iso8601>` explicitly to
override either — e.g. if `recovered/` isn't present, or to pin a reproducible value for a test
or release script. Re-run after each patch to refresh your local copy — it stays gitignored, so
don't commit it.

```

- `brotato_coach/tres.py` — a minimal Godot `.tres` parser.
- `brotato_coach/builders/` — turn parsed `.tres` into enriched records (weapons with precomputed DPS
  lines, items with archetype flags, characters with gain modifiers, sets, and the verified
  `stat_mechanics` table).
- `brotato_coach/calc.py` — pure DPS / merge math (no I/O), unit-tested against hand-verified values.
- `brotato_coach/{query,answers,evaluate}.py` — pure functions that produce finished answers.
- `brotato_coach/runfile.py` — pure parser that normalizes a Brotato `run.json` save into a build
  (character, weapons, items, realized stats) for `evaluate_run`; the only I/O is reading the save file.
- `brotato_coach/server.py` — thin FastMCP wrappers over those functions.

Reference material on the game mechanics the coach encodes lives in [`docs/`](docs/)
(extraction setup, weapon-merge DPS methodology, run post-mortem methodology, stat mechanics).
